Reflection is a game created for my CS 485 class at California State University San Marcos using Unity3D.

# CS 485 - Reflection

The game is called Reflection. It's a puzzle game where you control a character that uses a reflective shield to solve enigmas and protect himself from the dangers of the ancient temple he is exploring.

### Concept Overview
- The player evolves through different levels in an ancient unexplored temple filled with obstacles and puzzles to solve.
- The player has a shield that is used to reflect shots (lasers) from the enemies.
- He has to reflect on the proper angle to activate or destroy triggers and enemies.
The shield can absorb shots from the enemies to shoot back later in order to destroy them (acts as a gun that is loaded by the enemyâ€™s shots).
- There is EMP items that you can load by redirecting lasers at them, then pick them up, and then detonate them to deactivate enemies for a few seconds.
- Enemies and triggers can have different colors and the player must reflect the right color to activate the corresponding triggers or destroy the corresponding enemies.
- You can place alternative smaller shields that are either lasting a few seconds or indefinitely to reflect lasers a second time.

### Plot
The player character is an explorer who was searching for this legendary temple. In the first room of the temple he finds a conscious energy shield that talks to him and helps him through the temple. Through the temple between rooms he finds murals on the wall which the shield translates to him that reveal how the civilization that built the temple fell.

### Characters
The player character is a greedy explorer who is searching for wealth and power in the ancient ruins of the lost empire.
The shield acts as a comedic adviser to the player. The shield witnessed the death of his people and wants to prevent it from happening again.
